Cancer Care in the UAE,Healthcare in the United Arab Emirates,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-96-0523-1_26,"{'h1': 'Abstract', 'p': 'The United Arab Emirates (UAE) plays a vital role within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and the Arab world. With one of the most advanced healthcare systems, the field of oncology care in the UAE is characterized by a unique blend of collaborations between the public and private healthcare sectors. Cancer ranks as the third leading cause of death in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Over the past five decades, cancer care in the UAE has undergone a remarkable transformation, progressing from a single center in Al Ain in 1979 to a network of more than 30 cancer centers and clinics scattered across the country, including at least four comprehensive cancer centers today. Despite notable advancements in medical care, there remains a significant disparity in the quality of cancer care among these centers, indicating a deficiency in robust cancer quality control throughout the UAE. Moreover, access to clinical trials faces obstacles due to a shortage of expertise, research infrastructure, and the UAE’s relatively small population, making it challenging to accrue patients for trials. The need for further improvements in oncology education and training is also evident and requires immediate attention. In this review, we aim to shed light on these crucial aspects, urging stakeholders to prioritize the enhancement of cancer care in the UAE. We further highlight the state of oncology care in the UAE, focusing on key areas with the potential for expansion and also delve into previously unexplored topics, including oncology medical tourism, psycho-oncology, onco-fertility, precision oncology, survivorship, oncology nursing, cancer support programs, and the response of the oncology sector to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, all within the context of the UAE’s cancer landscape. We also provide recommendations aimed at policymakers, regulators, payers, patient advocacy groups, and the UAE’s oncology community, focusing on the delivery and future planning of high-quality cancer care. These recommendations align with the UAE government’s vision of reducing cancer mortality and ensuring the provision of high-quality cancer care for both its citizens and residents.'}",2026-01-01
"Pathophysiology of Uremia, Preoperative Assessment and Risk Stratification",Surgery in Uremic Patients,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-92716-4_1,"{'h1': 'Abstract', 'p': 'Uremia, primarily caused by chronic kidney disease (CKD), is a systemic disease affecting various organ systems and leading to metabolic imbalances, cardiovascular complications, and immune dysfunction. These factors increase the risk of adverse outcomes during and after surgery. A preoperative risk stratification, particularly assessing cardiovascular status and fluid balance, is useful given the high prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and other comorbidities in CKD patients. Currently available risk prediction models and their limitations should be carefully considered, as they may further enhance clinical decision making and inform preoperative planning in this population. To mitigate the impact of surgery and minimize complications in the postoperative period, proper timing of preoperative dialysis is crucial for managing electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and uremic toxin buildup.'}",2026-01-01
Cystic fibrosis–related kidney disease—emerging morbidity and disease modifier,Pediatric Nephrology,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00467-025-06715-3,"{'h1': 'Abstract', 'p': ['Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening multisystem disease resulting from mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, causing the most devastating phenotypes in the airway and pancreas. Significant advances in treatment for CF lung disease, including the expanded use of high-efficiency modulator therapies (HEMT) such as Trikafta, have dramatically increased both quality of life and life expectancy for people with CF (PwCF). With these advances, long-term extrapulmonary manifestations are more frequently recognized. Pseudo-Barter syndrome, acute kidney injury (AKI) induced by medications or dehydration, amyloidosis, nephrolithiasis, and IgA and diabetic nephropathies have been previously reported in PwCF. Newer data suggest that chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a new morbidity in the aging CF population, affecting 19% of people over age 55. CKD carries a high risk of premature death from cardiovascular complications. Studies suggest that CFTR dysfunction increases kidneys’ vulnerability to injury caused by the downstream effects of CF. Improving the mutant CFTR function by HEMT may help to tease apart the kidney responses resulting from extrinsic factors and those intrinsically related to the CFTR gene mutations. Additionally, given the novelty of HEMT approaches, the potential off-target effects of their long-term use are currently unknown. We review the evolving kidney complications in PwCF and propose the term CF-related kidney disease. We hope this review will increase awareness about the changing phenotype of kidney dysfunction in PwCF and help prevent morbidity related to this condition.', 'Graphical abstract', 'A higher resolution version of the Graphical abstract is available as Supplementary information']}",2025-12-01
Brain Region-Specific Accumulation of Amyloidosis-Associated Proteins in Postmortem Brain Tissues of Alzheimer’s Disease Patients,Molecular Neurobiology,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12035-025-05231-7,"{'h1': 'Abstract', 'p': 'Numerous extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, referred to as the matrisome, are increased in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We recently demonstrated that many of these proteins colocalize with Aβ plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and some are present in dystrophic cellular processes within and around plaques. However, their precise roles in AD pathogenesis and their spatial and temporal distribution in postmortem brain tissue remain incompletely understood. Here, we performed a comprehensive immunohistochemistry analysis on postmortem brain samples spanning the spectrum of AD neuropathological change (ADNC: low, intermediate, and high). We assessed the accumulation of five matrisome proteins (MDK, SPOCK3, COL25aA1, SDC4, and EGFL8) across four brain regions differentially affected in AD (occipital cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and cerebellum) and examined their association with Aβ plaques, CAA, tau neurites, and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). MDK in plaques increased consistently with ADNC severity across all regions. In contrast, SPOCK3, COL25A1, EGFL8, and SDC4 showed marked accumulation only in the occipital cortex and hippocampus, with sparse presence in the striatum and absence in the cerebellum. Notably, SPOCK3 exhibited pronounced regional specificity, with significantly higher levels in the hippocampus than in other areas. Morphological patterns of staining and degree of colocalization with Aβ and tau indicate that select matrisome proteins associate with either distinct types of Aβ deposits (neuritic versus diffuse plaques), while others may overlap more closely with tau pathology and/or dystrophic processes around plaques. Overall, our findings reveal region- and pathology-specific patterns of matrisome protein accumulation during AD progression. These proteins represent intriguing biomarkers of AD and are\xa0based on modeling studies potential therapeutic targets.'}",2025-12-01
Inflammation in cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome: key roles and underlying mechanisms–a comprehensive review,Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11010-025-05379-9,"{'h1': 'Abstract', 'p': 'Cardiovascular-Kidney-Metabolic (CKM) syndrome, a newly defined systemic disorder, is characterized by the pathological interplay among diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recent studies have identified chronic inflammation not only as a central mediator in the pathological progression of CKM syndrome but also as a pivotal molecular hub that drives coordinated damage across multiple organ systems. Mechanistic investigations have revealed that aberrant activation of signaling pathways such as NF-κB, Wnt, PI3K-AKT, JAK-STAT, and PPAR constitutes a complex inflammatory regulatory network. Notably, these pathways facilitate inter-organ inflammatory crosstalk, establishing positive feedback loops among the heart, kidneys, and metabolic tissues. This, in turn, amplifies pathological processes such as oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and fibrosis in a cascading manner.This review systematically delineates the multidimensional pathophysiological mechanisms of CKM syndrome, with particular emphasis on the inter-organ inflammatory regulation mediated by key signaling pathways. Furthermore, we explore the translational potential of therapeutic strategies targeting inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) based on the latest clinical evidence, aiming to provide a theoretical framework and novel perspectives for disrupting the vicious cycle of CKM syndrome.'}",2025-12-01
The Role of Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein in the Neuropathology of Alzheimer’s Disease and Its Potential as a Blood Biomarker for Early Diagnosis and Progression,Molecular Neurobiology,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12035-025-05219-3,"{'h1': 'Abstract', 'p': 'Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterised by neuropathological hallmarks, including extracellular amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The disease is clinically defined by cognitive dysfunction, including learning, memory deficits, and behavioural changes. With the rising global prevalence of AD, early diagnosis is critical for implementing effective interventions before irreversible neuronal damage occurs. Biomarkers correlating amyloid deposition, tau pathology, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration are currently being investigated using cerebrospinal fluid analysis and positron emission tomography imaging. These methods are invasive or costly, limiting their widespread clinical utility. Blood-based biomarkers offer a promising alternative due to accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and feasibility for large-scale screening. Among blood-based biomarkers, plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels have gained interest in identifying individuals at risk of AD at preclinical stages. However, significant challenges remain, including methodological inconsistencies, analytical variability, and the need for standardisation across immunoassay platforms to ensure the clinical applicability of plasma GFAP measurement in AD diagnosis. Additionally, the specificity of GFAP for AD needs further evaluation, as increased plasma levels are also observed in other diseases. Similar issues are found with p-tau 217, the blood biomarker candidate for AD that has received the most attention. This review summarises the role of GFAP in the neuropathology of AD, provides evidence on plasma GFAP as an early blood biomarker for AD and identifies key knowledge gaps that need to be addressed. Future advancements in assay development and large-scale longitudinal studies are essential to validate its diagnostic and prognostic potential for community-based AD screening.'}",2025-12-01
Experiences of stigmatization and its impacts among individuals living with hereditary diseases and family members in Portugal: an exploratory study,Journal of Community Genetics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12687-025-00782-7,"{'h1': 'Abstract', 'p': 'Stigma is defined as the perception of an undesirable attribute that leads to discrimination against individuals and groups. Stigmatisation is often triggered due to visible physical or cognitive differences. Although the literature consistently highlights the (fear of) stigmatisation as a significant concern among individuals living with hereditary conditions, no studies in Portugal have specifically provided evidence on this issue. This study aims to address this gap by examining the experiences and impact of stigma on individuals and families affected by hereditary diseases in Portugal. After receiving ethics approval, a total of 216 participants, including affected individuals, asymptomatic carriers and family members from families with a range of hereditary conditions, were recruited through patient support associations. Participants completed an online questionnaire via Limesurvey. Data were analysed through Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), median comparison tests, and thematic analysis. Of the participants, 78.7% were women, 55.6% had a university degree, and 20.4% were aged between 42 and 47 years. Findings indicate that stigma impacts individuals across various domains, including social interactions, institutional settings, the workplace, and healthcare. EFA identified a bi-factorial model of stigma, comprising Stigma Experiences and Perceived Support subscales, and the overall scale demonstrated high internal consistency (α\u2009=\u2009.879). Women and younger participants reported higher levels of stigma. Religiosity and humor emerged as key coping strategies. This study is the first in Portugal to assess stigma among individuals living with hereditary conditions. Our findings contributed to validating a measurement instrument, identified sociodemographic variations, and examined the psychosocial dimensions of stigma among affected patients. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive strategies to address and mitigate stigma, improve support systems, and enhance the well-being and healthcare experiences of individuals and families impacted by hereditary diseases.'}",2025-12-01
Interruption of the Gut Integrity Contributes to Early Accumulation of Amyloid-β in the Enteric Nervous System in Rats Supplemented with a High-Fat Diet,Molecular Neurobiology,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12035-025-05261-1,"{'h1': 'Abstract', 'p': ['Consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) contributes to numerous chronic illnesses, including neurological disorders and gastrointestinal dysfunction. The study design included four groups, each consisting of six rats: the control group was fed regular chow, while groups 2 (HFD 2W), 3 (HFD 4W), and 4 (HFD 8W) were given a 60% HFD for 2, 4, and 8\xa0weeks, respectively. A significant change in the latency to the platform in the water maze, a decrease in the percentage of successful cycles in the Y-maze, and a reduction in the percentage of time spent with the novel object were observed between the baseline and endpoint results in the HFD 4W and HFD 8W groups; notably, this was not the case in the control and HFD 2W groups. Consistent with the increased duration of HFD intake, marked damage to the cortical pyramidal cells as well as the mucosa of the ileum and colon was recorded. The optical density of amyloid deposition was significantly increased in the myenteric plexus before the cerebral cortex. In conclusion, increasing the duration of 60% HFD consumption was associated with significant deterioration of spatial and working memory, an increase in lipid profile, and amyloid deposition in the enteric nervous system, which began even before the observable involvement of the cerebral cortex.', 'Graphical Abstract', '']}",2025-12-01
Targeting GPR3 as a novel approach for nicotine cessation therapeutic development,Neuropsychopharmacology,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41386-025-02202-3,"{'h1': 'Abstract', 'p': 'Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death worldwide. Unfortunately, currently available cessation aids have limited long-term efficacy. GPR3 is a Gαs coupled receptor expressed in discrete brain regions, with notably high expression in cholinergic neurons of the medial habenula. Here, we investigated whether modulation of GPR3 could be a viable target for therapeutic development to promote nicotine cessation. We first examined whether our recently developed GPR3 receptor agonist, RTI-19318-32, could induce effects on intravenous nicotine self-administration at low, moderate or high nicotine doses in mice. We found that in both males and females, RTI-19318-32 significantly reduced nicotine intake at all self-administered nicotine doses, thereby supporting the validity of this therapeutic approach for individuals using varying levels of daily nicotine. RTI-19318-32 was further validated as being selective for GPR3, as it did not alter nicotine intake in GPR3 knockout mice, nor did it exert effects on anxiety-associated behavior or locomotion. While the higher RTI-19318-32 dose attenuated food-related reinforcement behavior, it was ineffective in altering baseline food consumption. Moreover, the lower RTI-19318-32 dose did not alter food reinforcement behavior, indicating selectivity in mediating nicotine intake. Finally, GPR3 expression co-localized with multiple nAChR subunits in the medial habenula, thereby supporting our proposed targeted approach for circuit engagement intentionally directed at modulating the drive to consume nicotine. Taken together, these data reveal the functional significance of agonist-inducted activation of the GPR3 receptor and establish the validity of focusing on therapeutic development of GPR3 ligands for nicotine cessation.'}",2025-12-01
"From stigma to increased social acceptance? Living with Machado-Joseph disease in São Miguel, Azores, Portugal",Journal of Community Genetics,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12687-024-00731-w,"{'h1': 'Abstract', 'p': 'This study describes the experiences with the stigma attached to Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) in São Miguel Island, the Azores (Portugal). We draw on semi-structured interviews with persons with MJD, family members, healthcare professionals, and direct care providers recruited through the local patient’s association ( n \u2009=\u200928). Qualitative thematic analysis revealed three main themes: (i) the intense stigma associated with MJD in the past; (ii) the current tendency towards increased openness; and (iii) increased availability of information about MJD and support. The findings suggest that stigmatization was more frequent and intense in the past. Still, there is currently a decrease in the intensity of perceived stigma, accompanied by an increasing awareness about MJD within the community. The local patient’s association is noted for playing a pivotal role in raising awareness about MJD in the community and fostering the confidence of individuals with MJD and their families to engage socially, which may help to reduce or mitigate feelings of stigma. This raises questions about whether the diminished stigma towards MJD in São Miguel results from heightened awareness about the condition, a decrease in the social acceptability of stigma, or a gradual internalization and normalization of stigma among individuals with MJD as a coping mechanism.'}",2025-12-01
